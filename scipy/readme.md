|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| scipy | SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. |
| [effect-size](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/effect_size.ipynb) | Explore statistics that quantify effect size by analyzing the difference in height between men and women.  Uses data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to estimate the mean and standard deviation of height for adult women and men in the United States. |
| [sampling](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/sampling.ipynb) | Explore random sampling by analyzing the average weight of men and women in the United States using BRFSS data. |
| [hypothesis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/hypothesis.ipynb) | Explore hypothesis testing by analyzing the difference of first-born babies compared with others. |
